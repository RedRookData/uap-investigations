In March 2024, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) released its first Historical Record Report — a congressionally mandated review of U.S. government UAP programs dating back to 1945. It is the most comprehensive official accounting of UAP-related activities ever made public.

Here is what it actually says, sourced directly from the document.

## What AARO Concluded

The report's central finding is direct: AARO found **no verifiable evidence** that the U.S. government has recovered non-human intelligence, extraterrestrial spacecraft, or reverse-engineered alien technology. Forty-one individuals with alleged knowledge of classified programs were interviewed. None provided corroborating documentation.

This finding has been widely cited — but often stripped of its important qualifications.

## The Qualifications AARO Included

The report explicitly acknowledges several limitations that are frequently omitted from summaries:

**Classification barriers.** AARO states it was unable to review all relevant classified programs. Some programs remained outside the scope of the review due to classification compartmentalization.

**Witness credibility.** The report notes that several interviewees provided testimony that was internally consistent and delivered with sincerity, even where it could not be corroborated. AARO does not characterize these witnesses as deceptive.

**Ongoing uncharacterized cases.** The historical review does not address current UAP cases. AARO's operational case database, which includes cases that remain uncharacterized, is separate from this report.

## What the Report Covers

The Historical Record spans government UAP investigation programs from 1945 through the present, including:

- **Project SIGN (1947–1949):** The Air Force's first formal UAP investigation
- **Project GRUDGE (1949–1952):** Its successor, characterized by a more dismissive posture
- **Project BLUE BOOK (1952–1969):** The longest-running official UAP investigation, closed with the Condon Report
- **AATIP (2007–2012):** The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, run by Luis Elizondo at the Pentagon
- **UAPTF (2020–2022):** The UAP Task Force, predecessor to AARO
- **AARO (2022–present):** Current operational program

## The Grusch Contradiction

The report directly addresses testimony from David Grusch, a former intelligence officer who testified before Congress in 2023 that the U.S. government possesses recovered non-human craft and biological material. AARO characterizes Grusch's claims as unsubstantiated based on its review.

Grusch has publicly disputed the report's methodology, stating that AARO did not have access to the programs he was referring to. This dispute is unresolved in the public record.
