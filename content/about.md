## What This Is

UAP Investigations is a research platform dedicated to indexing, analyzing, and archiving primary source documents related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

We work exclusively with:
- Declassified government documents
- FOIA-released records
- Official congressional testimony and hearing transcripts
- Published military incident reports
- Peer-reviewed academic research from organizations like the [Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies](https://www.explorescu.org/)
- Official reports from AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office)

## What This Is Not

This is not a news aggregator. We do not republish rumors, anonymous sources, or unverified claims. Every piece of content on this site cites a named primary document.

This is not a speculation platform. We report what the record says. When the record is unclear, we say so.

## What We Offer

**Free research** — Indexed case summaries, document analyses, and weekly blog posts. No paywall on the primary content.

**The Investigation Brief** — A weekly newsletter covering new disclosures, document releases, and congressional activity. Free tier available. Paid subscribers receive full analysis.

**Research Reports** — Deep-dive PDF reports on specific cases, events, or document sets. Sold individually.

**AI Research Assistant** — Coming soon. A subscription-based AI tool trained on our full document corpus. Ask questions, get sourced answers from the actual documents.
